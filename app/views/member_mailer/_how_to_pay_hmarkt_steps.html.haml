  # This partial shows the steps for how to pay the H-Markt licensing fee,
  # the link to log in (with a reminder about the email to use), and a link
  # to the company that needs the H-markt paid (that's the page where it's paid).
  # Note that it does not include a step to log in. That should be explained
  # elsewhere, in case this is shown with other steps that also require logging in --
  # in which case the step(s) for logging in can be shown just once.
  #
  # The partial expects these locals:
  #   email - the email address for logging in
  #   company - the company (object); used for displaying the name and the url
