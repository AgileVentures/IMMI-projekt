# @class AbstractUpdater
#
# @desc Abstracts the behavior and information common to the Updaters.
#
#       Updaters check to see if requirements are met, and then do something
#         ("do events and update info")
#       If requirements are not met, the Updater checks to see
#           if it is ok to 'revoke the update with events and info'.
#       Often there is an opposite of the 'update the info' action;
#           this is the 'revoke the update' action.
#
#       If the requirements are met, do events and update info ('update_action').
#       Else  (the requirements are not met)
#          if it is ok to revoke the update with events and info (''),
#             do whatever is needed to revoke the update with events and
#               info ('revoke_update_action')
#
#       Typically an Updater will work with another class (service/object/interface)
#       or classes that has (have) the responsibility for checking the requirements.
#
#       Updaters are singletons
#
#
#       Each subclass MUST define the following methods:
#         'self.update_requirements_checker'  returns the AbstractRequirements class
#             that is responsible for checking that the
#             requirements are met/it's ok to "do events and update info"
#         'self.revoke_requirements_checker'  returns the AbstractRequirements class
#             that is responsible for checking that the
#             requirements are met/it's ok to 'revoke the update with events and info'
#
#         'update_action(args)'  does whatever is needed to be done
#             when the requirements are met
#             ex:  send email, update attributes, etc.
#
#         'revoke_update_action(args = {})'  does whatever is needed to be done
#             to "revoke (undo)" the update action
#             ex:  send email, update attributes, etc.
#             It's quite possible that there is nothing to be done,
#               and so this method might just be empty (= do nothing)
#             It is not defined in this abstract class so that
#               an error is raised if it is not defined, thus ensuring
#               that the author(s) of subclasses explicitly consider
#               what does or does not need to happen.
#
#       (If a subclass does not need that methods, it's fine to not define it.)
#
#
#       It is the responsibility of each subclass to parse the arguments as needed.
#       They are handled as a *Hash* to allow for variation in the number and type(s) of
#       arguments that are needed by subclasses.
#
#
#       It is currently also used to abstract out some logging just for
#       demonstration purposes during the spike/exploration.
