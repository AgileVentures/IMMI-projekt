# @class AbstractReqsForMembership
#
# @desc Responsibility: Knows what the membership requirements are for a User
#       - Given a user, it can respond true or false if membership requirements are met.
#
#       This is a very simple class because the requirements are currently very simple.
#       The importance is that
#       IT IS THE ONLY PLACE THAT CODE NEEDS TO BE TOUCHED IF MEMBERSHIP REQUIREMENTS ARE CHANGED.
#
#  Only 1 is needed for the system.
