# @class MembershipStatusUpdater
#
# @desc Responsibility:  Keep membership status up-to-date based the current business rules
#    and requirements.
#  - gets notifications from events in the system and does what is needed with them to
#    update the status of memberships for people in the system
#
#    This is a Singleton.  Only 1 is needed for the system.

#
#
# The Observer pattern is used to send notifications (methods) when something
# 'interesting' has changed.  When the MembershipStatusUpdater receives one of these
# notifications, it checks the membership to see if it needs to be changed (updated
# or revoked).  It does this via the :check_requirements_and_act({ user: user })
# method.  (This method is the public interface and main method for all
# Updater classes.)
#
# This check is logged with the ActivityLogger so that anything that happens is
# logged.
#
#
#   MembershipStatusUpdater has the responsibility of checking to see if the membership
#   should be updated or revoked based on the current business rules.
#   Thus all of the business rules can be in just _one place_ (DRY).
#   Only 1 class has the responsibility for enforcing them.  No other classes have to care about them.
#
#   Satisfies the "Open/Closed" principle in SOLID:  putting the business logic
#   into 1 Observer class keeps it open to extension changes (just this class)
#   but closed to having to modify lots of code when the requirements change
#
#   Business logic for when a Membership is granted or revoked is encapsulated into 1 class
#   that others are _not_ coupled to.
#   Ditto with logic about Membership terms - whether they have expired or not,
#   how the ending (expire) date is changed, etc.
