# @class RequirementsForRenewal
#
# @desc Responsibility: Knows what the requirements are for a Member to renew membership.
#       - Given a member, it can respond true or false if the membership renewal requirements are met.
#   Note that it is _not_ the responsibility of this class to know if the given member has been
#   unpaid so long that they cannot simply 'renew' but must re-apply.
#
#       This is a very simple class because the requirements are currently very simple.
#       The importance is that
#       IT IS THE ONLY PLACE THAT CODE NEEDS TO BE TOUCHED IF MEMBERSHIP REQUIREMENTS ARE CHANGED.
#
#  Only 1 is needed for the system.
