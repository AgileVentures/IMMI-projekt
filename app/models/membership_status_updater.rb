# @class MembershipStatusUpdater
#
# @desc Responsibility:  Keep membership status up-to-date based the current business rules and requirements.
#  - gets notifications from events in the system and does what is needed with them to
#    update the status of memberships for people in the system
#
#    This is a Singleton.  Only 1 is needed for the system.

#
# Goals with this PR:
#   - show how the Observer pattern can and should be used to keep Membership status up to date
#   - Single Responsibilty:  each class should have a *single* responsibility
#     - Currently, the User class is waaay too big!  it has too many responsibilities.
#       This moves the "update membership status based on the business rules"
#       responsibility out of it into the MembershipStatusUpdater class
#
# The Observer pattern can and should also be used to update the company visibility:
#   CompanyVisibilityUpdater has the responsibility of checking to see if the company should currently be visible
#     based on the current business rules.  Thus all of the business rules are just in _one place_.
#     Only 1 class has the responsibility for enforcing them.  No other classes have to care about them.
#
# Satisfies the "Open/Closed" principle in SOLID:  putting the business logic
#   into 1 Observer class keeps it open to extension changes (just this class)
#   but closed to having to modify lots of code when the requirements change
#
#   Business logic for when a Membership is granted or revoked is encapsulated into 1 class that others are _not_ coupled to
#   Ditto with logic about Membership terms - whether they have expired or not, how the ending (expire) date is changed, etc.
#
#    - adding things that need to notify observers is easy:
#      1. include Observable
#      2. after_initialization :add_observers
#      3. def add_observers (and add the observers in that method)
#      4. where appropriate, let the observerse know a change has been made so they can do their thing
#
#
# Payments should split into a Factory and subclasses (MembershipFeePayment, BrandingFeePayment)
