# @class ConditionResponder
#
# @desc Responsibility: Take a condition and some configuration information
# and _responds_ (handles) the condition.
#
# This might mean looking thru members and sending them emails if
# some particular condition is met, for example.
#
# Although this class is nearly empty right now, it is here to clarify
# the overall design.
#
# TODO: ? rename to ConditionHandler - because it _handles_ conditions, it
# doesn't respond _to_ them or _with_ them (it doesn't send a Condtion to anything.
#  It queries them and does it's own thing)
