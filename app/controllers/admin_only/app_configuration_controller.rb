    # FIXME if the membership guideline list was changed,
    #  need to track _any_ membership guideline list that has been used in the past because
    #  we need a way to choose the master checklist for a user (that is: the membership guideline user checklist for a user).
    #  If this was changed...
    #   1) keep a list of all master checklists that have been used as a membership guideline list
    #   2) when a user checklist is created by the memebership guideline factory, mark it somehow as the
    #     _current_ membership guideline list.
