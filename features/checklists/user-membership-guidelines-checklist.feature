#  Scenario: User checks all guidelines - completes the list
#    Given I am logged in as "new_user@example.com"
#    And I am on the "user account" page for "new_user@example.com"
#    When I click on t("users.ethical_guidelines_link_or_checklist.agree_to_guidelines") link
#    Then I should be on the "first unchecked membership guideline" page for "new_user@example.com"
#    And I should see "MedlemsaÌŠtagande" in the h1 title
#    And I should not see t("next")
#    When I check the box t("user_checklists.show_progress.read_and_agree_start")
#      When I check the checkbox with id "completed-checkbox"
#    And I wait for 5 seconds
#    Then I should see t("next")


#  Scenario: User checks only some of the guidelines


#  Scenario: User checks none of the guidelines
