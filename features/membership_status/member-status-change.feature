Feature: Membership status updated due to payments or expiration

  As a member
  So that my membership status is always current and accurate
  The system must review dates, payments, and actions nightly

  Membership application state, membership payments, and H-branding (license) payments
  all affect membership status.
  The particular date also affects status:  has a membership expired?
  These all need to accurately change membership status.
