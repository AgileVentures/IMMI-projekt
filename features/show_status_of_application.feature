  Background:
    Given the following users exists
      | email         | admin |
      | din@mail.se   |       |
      | min@mail.se   |       |
      | admin@sgf.com | true  |

    And the following applications exist:
      | company_number | user_email  | status   |
      | 5562252998     | din@mail.se | Inl채mnad |
      | 2120000142     | min@mail.se | Godk채nd  |

  Scenario: Showing status in the application listing
    Given I am logged in as "admin@sgf.com"
    And I am on the list applications page
    Then I should see "2" applications
    And I should see t("membership_applications.index.status")
    And I should see "Inl채mnad"
    And I should see "Godk채nd"
