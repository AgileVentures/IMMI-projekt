Feature: Membership address get emails when a member has been unpaid for > 6 months

  As a nightly task,
  so that admins can check to see if lapsed members are still using the H-markt image but shouldn't be,
  assuming that anyone that still hasn't paid after 6 months is not going to pay for membership,
  Send an email to the membership address (not the admins!) with all members that are unpaid for 6 months.

  Timing for the task can be any valid Timing (e.g. every day, on a day of the month, etc.)
